mri same in old and newold code
TP not same.
1- so follow TP and see where the difference is. 
- TP stuff seems to be same outside of generateTPslice
- not really: replaced with old generate TP slice and got same messedupness, just extra lines are created... so problem outside??
I am here now

2- once that is done, try the real rigid way of doing it and compare. maybe provide results for both...
3- once that is done, if rigid resuts are back to bring in the 0.6, try the new new code and see what it does as results...

Ok, so the old rigid way is now giving me the new results... I wonder what is fishy...
- see if the right images are used 
- find the old images for that slice and compare - NOT same
  TP rigid not same, TP TPs same, MR rigid not same, MR articulated same, MR TPS same
- calculate the kappa with the old images and compare: old images = old kappa

problem: not the same images are produced..
i think all the entries are the same, the MRI image shift is not though. so try  the upper ones to see if the same thing is produced...
bad bad bad upper ones. could i have bad tx files? - unlikely cause the articulated is fine... but check in case.

slice 10: the new resampled resembles the resampledsegfull, which makes sense...
get same results as before visually. test kappas.. GOOD!!!!

back to 2-
a- try the newold results with old rigid way on slice 10.. good!
b- try newold results with new rigid way

try the new new code on that slice; just to see what happens... good!

slice 1 new new code: 0.83, 0.87, 0.97
slice1 newold code: obviously not doing anything...

TODO:
check if both codes have same MRI parameters
as is generate results using newofold and new for all patients...
